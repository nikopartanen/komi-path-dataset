# komi-prolative-dataset

This is an open access dataset that contains examples of via-cases in Komi varieties. Zyrian Komi is typologically unusual as it has two distinct cases to express this relatively rare function. Those cases are commonly called as prolative and transitive.

There are currently two datasets, one that represents standard written Komi, primarily from the early 20th century, and another that contains examples from various dialects.

The studies in which these materials have been used are:

> Niko Partanen & Riku Erkkilä: (Accepted.) Cases denoting path in Komi: Semantic, dialectological and historical perspectives. Linguistica Uralica.

> Niko Partanen & Riku Erkkilä 2020. Dialectal variation in the path-coding cases in Komi. In: Permistika 18. Dialekty i istorija permskix jazykov vo vzaimodeĭstvii s drugimi jazykami. Sbornik statej. Iževsk.

We hope that by creating an openly available dataset that contains verified and annotated examples in Komi language contributes into further research in this topic.

Many languages in the world have a case to express a movement along a path. These cases are regularly called with various names, which include prolative, prosecutive, transitive and many others. Still, to have a specific case for this function is something most of the languages do not do.
